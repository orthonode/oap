# Orthonode Systems — Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: February 2026**

### 1. Data Ingestion
Orthonode Labs processes high-resolution telemetry data, including GPS trajectories and raw accelerometer noise floors. This data is used solely for the purpose of deterministic physical verification.

### 2. Data Usage
We process telemetry to distinguish between genuine physical work and emulated spoofing. We do not sell, trade, or share granular device data with third parties without explicit consent from the audit partner.

### 3. Security & Zero-Trust
Orthonode is built on a transport-agnostic, zero-trust fabric. We prioritize the minimization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during the auditing phase.

### 4. Data Sovereignty
All data is processed in compliance with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act of India.
